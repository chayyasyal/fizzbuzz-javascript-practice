# Creating FizzBuzz using JavaScript

Here I have used basic JavaScript to create a simple FizzBuzz exercise which would work in browser to say that it knows when a number is divisible by 3. 
The test passes and opens as expected in browser when typing "open SpecRunner.html" in the Terminal. 

Aim of FizzBuzz task:

Here I was hoping to show that I could enter a function, a method etc using Jasmine. I have shown evidence of correct formatting
which includes camel casing, using the 'function' keyword and creating code which both works successfully and adheres to JavaScript conventions.
